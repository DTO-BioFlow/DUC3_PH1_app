        The <a href="https://dto-bioflow.eu/" target="_blank">DTO-Bioflow project</a>
        enables the integration of biodiversity monitoring data into the Digital Twin Ocean.
        The importance of this project is demonstrated by several policy-relevant Demonstrator
        Use Cases (DUC).
    </p>

    <p>
        Demonstrator Use Case 3 (DUC3) is one of the key Demonstrator Use Cases within the
        DTO-BioFlow project, focusing on the assessment of pelagic biodiversity and the impact
        of human activities in marine ecosystems. This use case is vital for informing
        environmental policy and management, as it contributes directly to the OSPAR thematic
        assessments. By integrating biodiversity monitoring data into the Digital Twin Ocean,
        DUC3 provides valuable insights into ecosystem health, supporting evidence-based
        decision-making at both regional and global levels.
